## Getting Started

### Built With
React - https://reactjs.org/

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm are required to build and run this app. Install them from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

Follow these steps to install and deploy your React app on GitHub Pages:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
2. Configure Environment Variables:

    If your app requires environment variables (such as API keys or configuration settings), create a .env file in the root directory of your app and provide the necessary values:
    ```bash
    REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key
    REACT_APP_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
3. Install Dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
4. Run the Development Server:

    To start the development server and view your app in the browser:

    ### `npm start`
    This will launch the app on http://localhost:3000.
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

5. Build for Production:

    When you're ready to deploy your app to GitHub Pages, build the optimized production-ready version:

    ### `npm run build`
    This command creates a build folder with the optimized build files

6. Deploy to GitHub Pages:

    Once you have your production build, you can deploy your app to GitHub Pages:

    ### `npm run deploy`
    This command deploys your app using the gh-pages package, automatically pushing the build files to the gh-pages branch of your repository.

7. Access the Deployed App:

    After deploying, your app will be accessible at https://username.github.io/repository-name.
